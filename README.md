# Cpp-Grass_And_Goats
Practice large scale OOP with outputing the change of the World/Grass&amp;Goats day by day.

## This is a World full of grass and goats! Watch the interaction!
  * **"I"** stands for grass. **"X"** stands for a goat.
  * If you create a world, there will be initially **10 grass** and **5 goats**.
  * Each grass live **6 days** then die and will have baby from **day 3** to **day 5**.
  * Each goat lives **70 days** then die and will have baby from **day 50** to **day 55**.

## However ...
  * Each goat owns **20 "Grass point"** initially.
  * Goats need to move and consume any grass for **5 "Grass point"**.
  * Goats lose **1 "Grass point"** for moving *(Goats have to move once everyday)*.
  * Once **"Grass point"** falls to **0**, the goat dies.
  
## Usageï¼š
  * 1. make
  ```bash
  $ make
  ```
  * 2. Execute main program, **ALifeTest_**, with an integer, **howManyDaysToLive**.
  ```bash
  $ ./ALifeTest_* 100
  ```
  * 3. (output)
  * 4. clean files
  ```bash
  $ make clean
  ```
